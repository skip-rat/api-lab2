### Tasks

Here are some tasks for you to work on:

ðŸ“˜ Task 1: Implement the following User Story with tests.

`User Story: As a user, I want to use the Book Manager API to delete a book using its ID`

ðŸ“˜ Extension Task: Oh no! ðŸ˜­ We've only covered the happy paths in the solution, can you figure out a way
to add in exception handling to the project?

-   Clue 1: What if someone wants to add a book with an ID for a book that already exists? How do we handle this gracefully?

-   Clue 2: What if someone wants to find a book by an ID that doesn't yet exist?
    How can we improve the API by handling errors gracefully and show a helpful message to the client?
